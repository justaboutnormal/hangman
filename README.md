# hangman

Just a friendly game of hangman written in Clojure.

## Overview

To run:

    lein figwheel
    
Currently there are only two words the game knows, feel free to fork and add more.

## Future

While I created this mostly for practice, in the future I may add:

* WordNik integration (or similar API) to automatically select words
  * API keys would not be checked in.
* A "hint" feature that would all player to:
  * see the word's definition
  * get a free letter
