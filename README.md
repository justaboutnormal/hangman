# hangman

Just a friendly game of hangman written in Clojure. View it here: [Hangman!](http://mahonbaldwin.com/hangman/)

## Overview

To run:

    lein figwheel
    
Currently there are only a short list of words the game knows, feel free to fork and add more.

## Future

While I created this mostly for fun, in the future I may add:

* WordNik integration (or similar API) to automatically select words
  * API keys would not be checked in.
